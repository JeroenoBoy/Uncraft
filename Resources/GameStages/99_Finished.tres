description = "Dear factory architects,

We wish to joyfully inform you that we have conquered the car recycling industry, and our stakeholders are joyfully pleased. And this is ofcourse all thanks to your efforts.

We'd like to thank you for your excellent efforts by giving you 1 day off. You may send HR an email for when you wish for this to be.

We wish for you to continue your futile efforts to expand this excellent factory, ~ but we have so much fucking money it doesn't even matter ~.

Kind Regards,
John B.D. Richelieu"
